On the other had, the galaxies in a cluster orbit at speeds greater than expected, and in a way that can be explained if there is a large of amount of an unseen material that we call \"dark matter.\"  This dark matter turns out to be a more substantial component of the cluster than that of all the stars in all of the member galaxies.  Wait - if dark matter is invisible, then how can we see it?  Well, just as wind is invisible but we know it is there when it shakes trees, dark matter is also invisible but know it is there because it speeds up the motions of the galaxies.

    "Einstein tells us that mass bends light.  A very massive object will change the path of the light passing by it, similar to how eyeglasses change the path of the light.  This \"bending\" of light is called gravitational lensing.  In this experiment we are concerned with natural \"eyeglasses\" in space called lenses.  These lenses take the shape of a galaxy cluster, so they are humongous eyeglasses!  These lenses are not polished like real eyeglasses, and so produce distorted images instead of in-focus ones, and they even make you \"see double.\"  If this happened to a real pair of glasses then you would send them back to the shop.  How does a gravitational lens distort the light?  Well, the appearance of an otherwise circular-shaped object is bent into a banana-like shape that we call a gravitational arc, or just an \"arc.\"  In exceptional circumstances, that banana-like shape is large relative to the other galaxies.  In such cases we call the image a \"giant arc.\"  The aim of this experiment is to find the giant arcs, and to use them as a clue as to where and how big the natural lens is.\n",
