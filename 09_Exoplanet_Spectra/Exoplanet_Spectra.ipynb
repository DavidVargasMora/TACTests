    "Congratulations! You are now figuring out what planet atmospheres are made of or if a planet lacks an atmosphere. In real atmospheres, we will get a mix of molecules that can tell us about the planets' chemistry and someday even help us find life elsewhere in the Universe. Astronomers are exploring real planet atmospheres with current and future telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope. You can read about the Webb Telescope and see Images of it at [nasa.gov](https://jwst.nasa.gov/index.html).\n"
