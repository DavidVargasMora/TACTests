    "# Activity 1: What Are Black Holes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Black holes are astronomical objects that exert a extreme force of gravity due to their very high density and/or mass. If we describe gravity as the bending of the space, black holes bend space so strongly that there is a distance inside which even rays of light fall into the \"[well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_well)\" by following the curvature. This distance corresponds to the \"[event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon)\" of the black hole, and we cannot see or recover any information from what is inside this horizon.\n",

    "### How do we find Black Holes?\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot *see* black holes directly because no light comes out of them. However, we can find them because their gravitational pull affects anything that comes close. For instance, we can use telescopes to observe stars orbiting around them, such as the supermassive black hole _Sagittarius A*_ (pronounced A-star) at the center of our galaxy. The animation below shows the stars as they go around the center of the galaxy. We cannot see much of what they are orbiting around, but from the shape and speeds of the orbit, astronomers were able to calculate that the central dark object has a mass between 3 and 4 million times that of the Sun. Because that's a lot of mass in this small space, the only possible explanation is a supermassive black hole.\n",

    "Another way to find supermassive black holes is when there is a lot of material, such as interstellar gas, swirling around them. As this gaseous material swirls around the *gravitational well*, it takes the shape of a flatened disk that glows really brightly thanks to its extremely hot temperature. So while we still cannot see the black hole itself, we can observe the bright glow from the surrounding *accretion disk*. When this happens, it creates what astronomers call an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) at the center of the galaxy. The most luminous AGN are called *quasars*. In quasars, the central point of light from the active nucleus is so luminous that it outshines the entire galaxy and its hundred billion stars.\n",

    "                Illustration of the difference in light-travel time between the far-edge, middle, and near-edge of a source. If there were a sudden flash of light (a flare), the light would take more time to travel from the far side compared to the middle and near side of the object that has the flare. The difference in travel time between the far side and near side tells us how fast the total light can possibly vary (either rise to a peak, or drop back down to the normal level). In the artist illustration above, the radius (from center to one edge) takes one week in light travel time, so it has a maximum size of one <i>light-week</i>, which means 181.44 billion km. The diameter is two light-weeks, or 362.88 billion km.\n",

    "As you have seen, Active Galactic Nuclei are powered by supermassive black holes and they can emit A LOT of energy. Potentially, this energy can affect the galaxy because it can create winds that remove (or heat) the gas of the galaxy. If the gas is lost or if it is too hot, it's not longer available to form new stars. This means that the galaxy in question will stop forming new stars and it will gradually age and fade. However, astronomers are still not sure of the effects because in some cases, it seems that the energy just gets out of the galaxy or that the galaxy has some way of protecting itself. This is an ongoing and active field of research. **Maybe one day *you* can help to solve this mystery!**\n",
